Interactive Geospatial Query Appliction

## 1. Project Overview
### Motivation
The main purpose of this project is to aid new comers to data analytics understand how queries on geospatial data works. Using the Gowalla dataset, it provides an interactive web based map interface that allows users to execute predefined queries in order to better understand the queries and the data set. This addresses the main problem that new comers to data analytics have where they may lack the technical ability to execute queries and interpret the data by offering a user friendly, intuitive experience in the form of this application. 

### Web Application Functions
- There are two main functionalities of this website:
  - Interactive map: A majority of the space on the website is allocated to the interactive map, where users can view the results of their queries.
  - Query sidebar: A sidebar that contains all the predefined queries(with descriptions of each query) where the user can enter inputs and execute the queries.
-Since a majority of the queries depend on the longitude, latitude and check in time of each user, there is a great need for high-dimensional queries in this application
